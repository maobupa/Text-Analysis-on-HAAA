## Detailed Project Summary
Home and Space--A Computational Literary Analysis on Asian American Immigrants


The idea of my summer research stems from a class project I’ve completed for ENGL 395 Translational Humanities. The project is based on the Houston Asian American Archives (HAAA) managed by the Chao Center for Asian Studies at Rice, which collects, documents, and preserves Houston Asian American Immigrants’ experience through interviews and archival materials. 


In the original project, I went through several boxes of family archives at the Woodson Research Center and crafted a video poetry to retell the story of a Chinese immigrant woman. Due to time constraint, however, I wasn’t able to devote sufficient attention to the hundreds of interview transcripts stored at HAAA website. Recognizing the incompleteness of my project, I aspired to dedicate this summer to thoroughly explore these valuable resources and generate a more comprehensive picture of the immigrants’ experiences. 


Having an interest in Digital Humanities (DH), I was keen on leverage modern technology to address humanities questions. Given the substantial volume of data involved, I decided it was a great opportunity to experiment with text analysis methods, which employed computational techniques to analyze large text corpora. 
While DH resources within Rice’s curriculum were limited, I received guidance from professors familiar with the realm who directed me towards several summer DH workshops that for humanities scholars. Two prominent options were the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) at the University of Victoria in Canada and the Dream Lab hosted by the Price Lab of Humanities at University of Pennsylvania. My original plan was to attend the in-person DHSI session, the oldest and largest DH workshop, as per my initial application. However, due to visa delays, I opted to attend the Dream Lab at UPenn in person while participating in the second week of DHSI virtually.


At the Dream Lab, I enrolled in a Text Analysis course taught by Dr. J.D. Porter. This week-long experience at UPenn’s library proved both rewarding and educational. The course delved into basic text analysis methods encompassing aspects such as the most frequent words, most distinctive words, collocates, most distinctive collocates, type/token ration, part-of-speech tagging and narratological approaches. Through hands-on exercises, I acquired practical skills in employing computational tools, including Excel for metadata manipulation, Jupyter notebooks for Python programming, Tableau for data visualization, Gephi for network analysis, and Mallet for topic modeling. It was enlightening to witness how even simple tools like Excel could yield profound textual insights with minimal manipulation. Additionally by observing Dr. Porter’s presentation on applying these tools to analyze data from actual projects, I gained a holistic understanding of the DH research pipeline. 


Upon returning from the workshop, I began implementing this knowledge in my research project. I downloaded 50 transcripts each from Chinese and Indian American immigrants, converting the PDF files into python-readable format through PyPDF and Pandas libraries. Following this, I performed data preprocessing, which involved tokenization, lemmatization, the removal of irrelevant terms (“haaa”, “rice university”, “page”, “interview”) and the elimination of stop words. Once data cleaning was completed, I initiated the analysis, focusing on exploring the immigrants’ experience through the lens of home, I began by extracting collocates (contextual words) for several keywords that are commonly associated with home, including “home”, “China/India”, “Houston”, “Asia”, “America.” For enhanced visualization, I generated Wordcloud images. My analysis uncovered recurring mentions of family-related terms such as “father,” “mother,” and “children” across all keywords, highlighting the central role of family within the concept of home. Moreover, words related to wars and politics frequently surfaced for keywords like "China," "India," and "Asia," indicating the potential influence of political upheaval on 20th-century immigration experiences. Notably, differences emerged between the Chinese and Indian corpora, with the latter containing a substantial number of religious-related terms, suggesting the significance of religion in the lives of Indian immigrants. Conversely, religious terms were notably absent in the Chinese corpus.


To delve deeper into the data's implications, I quantified the frequencies of "war" and "home" in both corpora. Notably, "war" appeared 218 times with a frequency of 0.05% in the Chinese corpus, whereas it appeared only 61 times with a frequency of 0.01% in the Indian corpus. This discrepancy hinted at the potentially profound impact of wars on Chinese immigrants, aligning with the historical context of the 20th century. The findings also resonated with the Indian Independence Movement, largely characterized by Gandhi's advocacy of non-violence, which may have mitigated the effects of political turmoil. Additionally, the term "home" appeared 371 times with a frequency of 0.09% in the Chinese corpus and 581 times with a frequency of 0.13% in the Indian corpus. This observation suggested that Indian immigrants tended to reference "home" more frequently during interviews compared to their Chinese counterparts.


While many statistical patterns aligned with expectations, intriguing anomalies emerged. Notably, the term "wife" was conspicuously absent from references to family members and the context of home. To ascertain whether this pattern was due to inherent bias in the data, I compiled metadata tables for all interviewees, including their names, gender (determined based on pronoun usage in the transcripts, with none identified as non-binary), and marital status. These tables were imported into Tableau, resulting in the creation of four pie charts depicting gender and marital status distributions for each corpus. The analysis revealed even gender distributions and a majority of interviewees reporting at least one marriage. Furthermore, I examined the word frequencies of "husband" and "wife" in both corpora, discovering that "wife" appeared as frequently as "husband." Thus, the absence of "wife" in the context of home was not attributable to gender-related biases. However, this text analysis method, while revealing patterns, does not provide explanations, necessitating further investigation through more intricate methods or traditional literary analysis.


Building upon the theme of marriage, I conducted an analysis of the most distinctive words in both corpora, identifying terms that held particular significance in one corpus compared to the other. This analysis led to the discovery of two notable words in the Indian corpus: "marriage" and "arranged." Together, these terms pointed to the prevalence of "arranged marriages" among Indian immigrants, aligning with their cultural practices. 


Beyond text analysis techniques, my experience at the Dream Lab provided insights into approaching statistical analysis from a humanities perspective. Dr. Porter, a literary scholar, demonstrated how literary theories can be combined with data analysis to derive deeper insights. Consequently, I incorporated this approach into my research. Upon reviewing the collocates for all keywords, which primarily consisted of location-related words, I discerned recurrent patterns that linked time, such as “time/hours/back/summer/years/after,” and space, such as “address/school/street,” within the interview narratives. This observation prompted consideration of theories of time and space, ranging from the relativistic views in physics, as proposed by Einstein, to philosophical perspectives like Kant's assertion that time and space form the framework of reality construction. Eventually, literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin introduced the concept of “chronotype”, signifying the artistic depiction of reality in literature. Bakhtin’s theory posits that various chronotypes delineate different genres, thereby shaping distinct representation of time and space within literary works. To illustrate, the Greek Romance novel orchestrates time through chance, positioning it as the paramount driver of the narrative. On the other hand, myths of the Golden Age introduce a future time that reverberates to influence the past and present. This perspective led me to consider whether the recurring correlation between time and space within the interview transcripts might manifest as a unique chronotype characterizing interview narratives. Such an observation hints at the possibility of interview transcripts constituting a distinctive literary genre in their own right.
In addition to exploring the connection between time and space, another pattern that entails the frequent appearance of movement-related verbs led me to philosopher Martin Heidegger's seminal essay titled "Building Dwelling Thinking." Heidegger's work delves into the concept of human existence as an interaction with the surrounding physical spaces. Fundamentally, dwelling is depicted as a journey through these spaces. What struck me as remarkable was how the statistical patterns extracted from the extensive corpus of text managed to concretize this abstract philosophical theory into actual appearances of different verbs. This process of translating abstract theories into quantifiable data aligns with Franco Moretti's concept of "Operationalization."


In the end, I had the fortune to present my research findings at the Association for Computers and the Humanities Conference 2023 in the format of an individual paper on Jun. 30. As probably the sole undergraduate presenter on the conference, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the Minter Summer Award for their invaluable support throughout my research journey. 


With over 30 CSV files, more than 20 plots, and an extensive codebase exceeding 1000 lines, my summer research has concluded. This project constituted an experimental exploration of text analysis methods within a computational literary analysis framework. The outcomes of my research underscore the potential of digital technology in the realm of humanities, particularly in advancing the scope and introducing novel perspectives to literary analysis. Looking ahead, some potential directions to extend the project includes the introduction of new techniques, such as topic modeling methods. Moreover, within the existing toolkit, there remains a wealth of uncharted territory, including deeper investigations into the distinctive lexical characteristics between the Chinese and Indian corpora to glean insights into colloquial habits. Additionally, scrutinizing the unique lexical markers within individual transcripts can yield further insights into specific thematic topics.
